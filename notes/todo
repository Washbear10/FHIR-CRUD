Validate each attribute before saving
      either leave empty strings or remove attribute alltogether, but NO NULL!
test behaviour of sending vs getting time (regarding  offset)
Implement search error handling (resource has been edited/deleted in the meantime)
when switching date tabs and user makes no change, it does not yet register a change in date, only on "onChange"
add descriptive labels/tooltips to fields
creat login functionality > avoid hardcoded credentials



Resume :
      create docker
      UPDATE DATAGRID AFTER PATCH OR WHATEVER!!!
      disable open close if copying


Done, further test when time:
      check if all elements are represented with corresponding cardinality
      birthdate switching date when chaning year in partial date
      test passing internalReactID to classes, and only set in constructor if not in arguments




Backlog:
      display name text if property existing
      add tooltips to every button/ui
      check if "shouldPrefixautoFocus" is still needed (aswell as suffix and given)
      bundle all multi-item inputs into new reusable component (names, prefix, coding ....) with their placeholder
      test better solution for empty inputs instead of placeholders (maybe pass newly Constructed instances => problem was with updating the reactID)
      rework approach for input dialog: better: just fill with resource, don't update resource every time ?
      implement Required field logic
      implement freesolo datetimeinputs
      set all inputs to empty strings instead of null > prevents defaulting to allowing all inputs and prevents mui errors in console
      fix memo / callbacks  for better performance within an attributeblock.
      go through all elements and read through descriptions and conditions. See if implementable easily
      reinvent autofocus
      Read about bindings and value sets (f.e. marital status)
      save token as cookie
      better performance rendering, check out memo again
      allow empty values, remove non-value inputs
      implement input for other attachment values
