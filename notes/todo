Validate each attribute before saving
      either leave empty strings or remove attribute alltogether, but NO NULL!
test behaviour of sending vs getting time (regarding  offset)
add descriptive labels/tooltips to fields



Resume :
      - text in address represented fully in parts!


Done, further test when time:
      check if all elements are represented with corresponding cardinality
      birthdate switching date when chaning year in partial date




Backlog:
      display name text if property existing
      add tooltips to every button/ui
      bundle all multi-item inputs into new reusable component (names, prefix, coding ....) with their placeholder
      test better solution for empty inputs instead of placeholders (maybe pass newly Constructed instances => problem was with updating the reactID)
      rework approach for input dialog: better: just fill with resource, don't update resource every time ?
      implement Required field logic
      implement freesolo datetimeinputs
      set all inputs to empty strings instead of null > prevents defaulting to allowing all inputs and prevents mui errors in console
      fix memo / callbacks  for better performance within an attributeblock.
      go through all elements and read through descriptions and conditions. See if implementable easily
      reinvent autofocus
      Read about bindings and value sets (f.e. marital status)
      save token as cookie
      better performance rendering, check out memo again
      allow empty values, remove non-value inputs
      implement input for other attachment values
      dont fetch endpoints every time new endpoint is added


notes for later:
- errors 
- data types description in FHIR section
- describe headers used
- describe data serialization
- valuesets + binding strength
- extensions
- describe what changes to fhir config are important:
      - patch
      - Basic Auth
      - 

Update:


marital status codes
_filter?
CORS allowed
PATCH activated
sort by
bundle delete responses
only ever "successfull" if no faulty response!
