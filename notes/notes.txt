Comparison:

	- smarthealthit.org apps: find suitable comparisons
	consider:
		- FHIR standard requirements (R4)
		- Open source
		- Pricing
		- License
		- Over-/under fullfillment of requirements
 	- Found:
		- Medplum
		- MedVertical (only enterprise at time of writing, Free version does not allow private FHIR server)
		- Commur (must create account, not allowed atm) , create account produces internal server error, npm registry private
		- ontoserver (focused on terminology, no CRUD on non-terminology related resources)
		- HAPI (no standalone GUI -> overkill, + GUI only displays + edits in raw JSON + does not provide config for Basic auth/oauth2 enabled settings)
	- MEdplum drawbacks ( inconsistencies )
		- no partial dates
		- no multiple prefixes or suffixes per name
		- allows custom values for codes (e.b. Gender)
		- name has no period
		- allows non-datetime values in datetime fields
		- not stable (requests like array:contains crashes 500)
		

Implementation:
	- Consider adhering to SMART on FHIR standard (problem - apparently SMART requires OAuth2)
	- consider parsing JSON specification of a Resource to render inputs 
		- reasons for:
			- better adaptability (easily add new resources)
			- less code duplication
		- reasons against:
			- takes much time to implement
			- introduces code complexity (because of edge cases like codes, restrictions like min-max ranges or , alternative is more intuitive to handle
			- Bug affects all resources
			- does not offer additional functionality
	- configure IBM Fhire server to support update as create (https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide#34-updatecreate-feature)
	- configure IBM to support _filter searches

	- caveats:
		- performance will suffer on very big Datasets (all rows saved in client memory)
			- if time -> implement server side pagination on datagrid
		-
